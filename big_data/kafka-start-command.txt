- Start zookeeper and kafka:

    sudo systemctl start zookeeper 
    sudo systemctl start kafka 

    + Verify both of the services status:

        sudo systemctl status zookeeper 
        sudo systemctl status kafka 


- Create topic:

    cd /usr/local/kafka 
    bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic "topicname" 

    + Use --create option to create a new topic
    + The --replication-factor describes how many copies of data will be created. As we are running with a single instance keep this value 1.
    + Set the --partitions options as the number of brokers you want your data to be split between. As we are running with a single broker keep this value 1.
    + The --topic define the name of the topic


- Show created topics:

    bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 


- Send and receive msg:
    

    + Run the producer: bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic "topicname"

    => You can exit this command or keep this terminal running for further testing. Now open a new terminal to the Kafka consumer process on the next step.

    + Run the consumer: bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic "topicname" --from-beginning
