Zutto Mayonaka de Iinoni. Stylized as ZUTOMAYO, 
is a Japanese rock group that debuted in 2018. Secretive by nature, 
the group has never released a full member list, crediting different people for music,
arrangements, and music video production each time.
The only member reoccurring in all of the group's output is the vocalist, an unidentified woman named 'ACA-Ne'.
Despite the little information released, the group is commercially successful. 
Zutomayo's three EP's have reached 8th, 1st, and 2nd on the Oricon Albums Chart, respectively. 
The group was also invited to perform at the 2019 Fuji Rock Festival a year after their debut.
